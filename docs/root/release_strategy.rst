Release Strategy
##################################################

All releases will have tags named after their version number and published on the `releases page <https://github.com/Axonius/axonius_api_client/releases>`_.

Major releases: x.0.0
==================================================

A major release is only done for architectural and model changes to the API client library. Any scripts that utilize this API library will probably not work in between major releases.

Minor releases: 1.x.0
==================================================

A minor release is only done when an API method is removed or its signature changes.

Micro releases: 1.0.x
==================================================

A micro release is done for any change that does not modify any existing API method.
