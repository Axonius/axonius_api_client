Installation
#########################

Install Python
============================================================

Download and install a :ref:`supported version<supported_versions>` of `python`_ for your platform.

If installing on Windows, make sure you check the option to add Python to the PATH.
This will ensure that not only the `python` and `pip` binaries are on the path,
but that the `axonshell` CLI script that comes with this package will be available on
the PATH after you install it.

Install the package using `pip`_
============================================================

axonius-api-client is listed on `pypi`_, so you can do pip install from any
platform that has python installed.

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install axonius_api_client

Offline installs using `pip`_
============================================================

If you need to install axonius-api-client to a system that doesn't have
access to the internet, there are a few hoops to jump through.

.. note::
    You will need to install `python`_ on both systems,

.. note::
    On Windows, each system should have should the
    `PATH variable updated`_ to include the Python directories:

    * C:\Program Files\Python38
    * C:\Program Files\Python38\Scripts

On the system that does have internet access, use the following command to download
all of the requirements as wheel packages:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip download -d d:\axonshell_pkg axonius-api-client

Copy the contents of d:\axonshell_pkg to the destination server, and then on the
destination server run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --no-index --find-links d:\axonshell_pkg --target d:\axonshell axonius-api-client

Install the package Using `pipenv`_
============================================================
