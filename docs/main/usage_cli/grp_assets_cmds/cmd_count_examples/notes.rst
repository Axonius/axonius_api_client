Notes
==========================================

.. note::

   This example works the same for both the ``devices count`` and ``users count`` commands.

.. note::

   If --query-file is supplied, it will override --query if that is also supplied.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`shellhell` for how to deal with quoting the --query value in various shells.
