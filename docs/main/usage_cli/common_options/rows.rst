Rows Option
###############################################

Any command that has a "-r / --rows" option expects it's input to be from
another commands output.

Showing sources
==============================================

You can view the commands that can supply input to a command with a "-r / --rows"
option by using the "-ss / --show-sources" option.

Piped input
==============================================

If "-r / --rows" is supplied as "-" (the default) the input is expected to be piped
in from STDIN.

File input
==============================================

If "-r / --rows" is anything other than "-", it must be the path to a JSON file
containing the output of one of the source commands.
